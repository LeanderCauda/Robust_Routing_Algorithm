# Final Assignment: Robust Journey Planning

PREVIEW

**Executive summary:** Build a robust SBB journey planner, and make a short video presentation of it, to be done as a **team project**.
* A short (7min max) video presentation of your work is due before **May 22nd, 23:59 CEST**
* In-progress code (not necessarily functional) is due before **May 26th, 23:59**, final code is due before **May 30, 23:59 CEST**.

----
## HOW-TO

### Delays modeling
To execute the project, the `inference.py` notebook must first be run. This step generates a Parquet file containing the delay distributions for each relevant context. The resulting data will subsequently be used to compute the confidence levels associated with each path.

### Journey planning
Once the delays are modeled, you can run the `notebook.ipynb` notebook to access the routing widget and compute paths with different parameters.

### Configuration
The file `config.py` contains all the configuration variables of the project with description of their usage.

## Problem Motivation

Imagine you are a regular user of the public transport system, and you are checking the operator's schedule to meet your friends for a class reunion.
The choices are:

1. You could leave in 10mins, and arrive with enough time to spare for gossips before the reunion starts.

2. You could leave now on a different route and arrive just in time for the reunion.

Undoubtedly, if this is the only information available, most of us will opt for option 1.

If we now tell you that option 1 carries a fifty percent chance of missing a connection and be late for the reunion. Whereas, option 2 is almost guaranteed to take you there on time. Would you still consider option 1?

Probably not. However, most public transport applications will insist on the first option. This is because they are programmed to plan routes that offer the shortest travel times, without considering the risk factors.

----
## Problem Description

In this final project you will build your own _robust_ public transport route planner to improve on that. You will reuse the SBB dataset (See next section: [Dataset Description](#Dataset-Description)).

Given a desired **date** and **arrival time**, and simple known **weather** conditions (e.g. _rain_ or _no-rain_), your route planner will compute the fastest route between departure and arrival stops within a provided confidence tolerance expressed as interquartiles.
For instance, "what route from _A_ to _B_ is the fastest at least _Q%_ of the time if I want to arrive at _B_ before instant _T_". Note that *confidence* is a measure of a route being feasible within the travel time computed by the algorithm.

The output of the algorithm is a list of routes between _A_ and _B_ and their confidence levels. The routes must be sorted from latest (fastest) to earliest (longest) departure time at _A_, they must all arrive at _B_ before _T_ with a confidence level greater than or equal to _Q_. Ideally, it should be possible to visualize the routes on a map.

In order to answer this question you will need to:

- Model the public transport infrastructure for your route planning algorithm using the data provided to you.
- Build a predictive delay model, or model of missing a connection, using the historical arrival/departure time data, and **at a minimum** one external sources of data (e.g. weather data).
- Implement a robust route planning algorithm using this predictive model.
- Test and **validate** your results. Note that we will put a particular emphasis on the scientific validation of your method.
- Implement a simple Jupyter-based visualization to demonstrate your method, using Jupyter widgets such as [ipywidgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_guide.html).

Solving this problem accurately can be difficult. You are allowed a few **simplifying assumptions**:

- We only consider journeys at reasonable hours of the day, and on a typical business day, and assuming a recent schedule.
- We allow short walking distances for transfers between two stops, and assume a walking speed of _50m/1min_ on a straight line "As the Crows Flies", i.e. regardless of obstacles, human-built or natural, such as building, highways, rivers, or lakes.
- The total walking distance over the full trip should not exceed a maximum (default 500m, you can make it configurable). 
- In the assessment, we will only consider journeys that start and end on station coordinates (train station, bus stops, etc.), never from a random location. However, walking from the departure stop to a nearby stop (or nearby stop to arrival stop) is allowed as long as the total walking distance is within the maximum.
- We only consider stops in a given area. We we want to be able to change the area before running your program (the _uuid_ of [Geo spatial data](#Geo-spatial-data) should be configurable).
- If necessary, stops within the specified area can be reached through transfers at stops located outside the area.
- There is no penalty for assuming that delays or travel times on the public transport network of **two different lines** are uncorrelated with one another.
- Once a route is computed, a traveller is expected to follow the planned routes to the end, or until it fails (i.e. miss a connection).
  You **do not** need to address the case where travellers are able to defer their decisions and adapt their journey "en route", as more information becomes available. This would require us to consider all alternative routes (contingency plans) in the computation of the uncertainty levels, which is more difficult to implement.
- The planner does not need to account for the inconvenience to the traveler in the event of a plan failure. Two routes with the same travel time, within the specified uncertainty tolerance, are considered equivalent, even if the consequences of one route failing are significantly worse for the traveler (e.g., being stranded overnight), while the other route's failure would result in a less severe outcome.
- All other things being equal, you will prefer routes with the minimum walking distance and minimum number of transfers.
- You do not need to optimize the computation time of your method, as long as the run-time is reasonable.
- When computing a path you may pick the timetable of a recent week and assume that it is unchanged.

Upon request, and with clear instructions from you, we can help prepare the data in a form that is easier for you to process (within the limits of our ability, and time availability). In which case the data will be accessible to all.

## Dataset Description

For this project we will use the data published on the [Open Data Platform Mobility Switzerland](<https://opentransportdata.swiss/en>).
For grading we will use recent SBB data limited around a city area of our choice (hold out data). We recommend that you develop a solution around Lausanne area and make sure that the solution will be able to work in a different or slightly larger area, and different period. We will select the area using a different region from the geo shapes table. The region _uuid_ from the table should therefore be a well documented parameter of your solution available as variable in the notebook. 

We will also provide you with a simulated realtime feed of Istdaten data.

For your convenience, we have defined the table for each of the data set described below in the database _iceberg.com490_iceberg_. You can list the tables with the command _SHOW TABLES IN iceberg.com490_iceberg_.  **DO NOT** drop the database, **DO NOT** drop the tables.

For your convenience we have made available to you a copy of the last few years of weather data reported at various airports in Swizerland. The data was downloaded from [wunderground](https://www.wunderground.com/history/daily/ch/r%C3%BCmlang/LSZH/date/2022-1-1).

You can find the data on HDFS under _/data/com-490/json/weather_history/_ and _/data/com-490/csv/weather_stations/_.

#### Others

You are of course free to use any other sources of data of your choice that might find helpful.

You may for instance download regions of openstreetmap [OSM](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=9/47.2839/8.1271&layers=TN),
which includes a public transport layer. If the planet OSM is too large for you,
you can find frequently updated exports of the [Swiss OSM region](https://planet.osm.ch/).

## Hints

Before you get started, we offer a few hints:

- Reserve some time to Google-up the state of the art before implementing. There is a substantial amount of work on this topic. Look for *time-dependent*, or *time-varying networks*, and *stochastic route planning under uncertainty*.
- You should already be acquainted with the data.
However, as you learn more about the state of the art, spend time to better understand your data.
Anticipate what can and cannot be done from what is available to you, and plan your design strategy accordingly. Do not hesitate to complete the proposed data sources with your own if necessary.
- Start small with a simple working solution and improve on it.
In a first version, assume that all trains and buses are always sharp on time.
Focus on creating a sane collaborative environment that you can use to develop and test your work in team as it evolves.
Next, work-out the risk-aware solution gradually - start with a simple predictive model and improve it. In addition you can test your algorithm on selected pairs of stops before generalizing to the full public transport network under consideration.

## FAQ

This section will be updated with the Frequently Asked Questions during the course of this project. Please stay tuned.

##### 1 - Q: Do we need to take into account walking times at the connections?
* **A**: Yes, but since we do not have the details of the platforms at each location, we can use a universal formula to come up with a reasonable walking time.
We must also allow time for transfers between different modes of transports, such as from bus to tramways.
You can use the transfer time information available from `transfers.txt` from the [timetables](#Timetable-data).
Otherwise, we assume that `2min` mininum are required for transfers within a same location
(i.e. same lat,lon coordinates), to which you add _1min per 50m_ walking time
to connect two stops that are at most _500m_ appart, on a straight line distance between their two lat,lon. 

##### 2 - Q: Can we assume statistical independence between the observed delays?
* **A**: See simplifying assumptions in **Problem Description**.
You will incur no penalty for assuming that the delay of a given train (or other mode of transport, ...), at a given location and time is
independent of the delays for all other trains, locations, and times. Even if our experience tells us that this is most of the time not the case.

##### 3 - Q: Can I take advantage of the fact that a connection departs late most of the time to allow a plan that would otherwise not be possible according to the official schedule.
* **A**: You may discover that you could take advantage of connections that have a high probability of departing late.
However, this is not recommended, or it should come with a warning.
Imagine from a user experience perspective, how would you react if you are being proposed an impossible plan in which a transfer is scheduled to depart before you arrive?
Furthermore, who would you blame if the plan fails: the planner that came up with a theoretically infeasible plan, or the operator who respected their schedule?
